# double tap test #

Simple example to demonstrate issue that can arrise when quickly tapping back and forwards with a navigation controller.

On iOS 7 it is possible to get the screen in a state where no touches are accepted.
On iOS 8 this does not seem possible but a lot of error messages are logged to the console
